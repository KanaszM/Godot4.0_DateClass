# Godot4.0_DateClass
The Date class is a powerful tool for precise manipulation of day, month, and year values. It can set, clamp, increment, and format these values, and also generate calendars and calculate ISO 8601 day and week numbers. It's ideal for building applications that require high levels of date precision.
